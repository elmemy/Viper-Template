# Viper-Template
Viper 

VIPER is an architectural pattern like MVC or MVVM, but it separates the code further by single responsibility. Apple-style MVC motivates developers to put all logic into a UIViewController subclass. VIPER, like MVVM before it, seeks to fix this problem. Each of the letters in VIPER is a component of the architecture: View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router.

- The View is the user interface.
- The Interactor is a class that mediates between the presenter and the data. It takes direction from the presenter.
- The Presenter is the “traffic cop” of the architecture, directing data between the view and interactor, taking user actions and calling to the router to move the user between views.
- An Entity represents application data.
- The Router handles navigation between screens.
